# Tip Calculator Website

## Introduction

Hello, fellow developers! I'm thrilled to introduce my latest project: a simple yet handy **Tip Calculator**. This project is a perfect opportunity to practice fundamental JavaScript concepts, such as handling user inputs, performing calculations, and dynamically updating the DOM. Whether you're new to JavaScript or looking for a small project to sharpen your skills, this Tip Calculator is a great choice.

## Project Overview

The **Tip Calculator** is a web-based application that allows users to quickly calculate the total amount to pay, including the tip, based on the bill amount and tip percentage. The project demonstrates how to create an interactive user interface, manage calculations, and provide real-time feedback to the user.
